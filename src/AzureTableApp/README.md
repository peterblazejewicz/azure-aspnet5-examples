# Azure Storage Table example application

Example ASP.NET5 console application demonstrates following topics:
- Azure Storage Table operations
- Async/Await patterns
- Configuration
- User Secrets
- commandline arguments

The example takes some code ideas and parts from:
- [How to get started with Azure Table storage and Visual Studio connected services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/vs-storage-aspnet5-getting-started-tables/)
The source code implementation differs in some points from article's snippets.
